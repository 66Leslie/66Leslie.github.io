# About Me

I am an undergraduate student (2023–Present) at the School of Electrical and Automation Engineering, **Nanjing Normal University**, majoring in **Automation**.

My primary interests are **robotics** and **UAV (drone) autonomy**, with a focus on:
* **Robot control** and simulation (e.g., multi-agent / 3D soccer)
* **UAV air-ground collaboration** and **reinforcement learning** for control
* **Embedded systems** (MCU/FPGA) development and system debugging

I also work with **robotic manipulators** and the **ROS ecosystem**, including:
* ROS (ROS1/ROS2), `catkin`/`colcon`, `rosbag`
* URDF/Xacro, TF, RViz
* Gazebo simulation
* MoveIt-based motion planning and basic kinematics

I have received the **National Second Prize** in the National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest (NUEDC), and I have also participated in embedded chip & system design competitions and robotics contests.

I am currently working on research projects including a **gravity energy storage system test platform** and **RL-based UAV height control** in air-ground collaborative scenarios.

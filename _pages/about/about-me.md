## 🤖 About Me

Hi! I'm an undergraduate student (2023–Present) at **Nanjing Normal University**, School of Electrical and Automation Engineering, majoring in **Automation**.

I’m interested in building **robotic systems that actually work end-to-end** — from reading papers and defining the problem, to implementing a runnable baseline, to iterating through experiments and debugging the full pipeline.

### 🔭 Research Interests
- **Embodied AI / Robotics**: autonomous environment understanding & robust reasoning for embodied agents  
- **Reinforcement Learning**: policy learning for UAV control and multi-agent collaboration  
- **Robotic Manipulation**: motion planning & simulation-to-deployment workflow

### 🧰 Robotics Stack
- **ROS**: ROS1 / ROS2, TF, RViz, URDF/Xacro  
- **Simulation**: Gazebo  
- **Manipulation**: MoveIt (motion planning), basic kinematics  
- **Dev**: Linux workflow, Git, system integration & debugging

### 🏆 Highlights
- **National Second Prize**, National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest (NUEDC)  
- Participated in **embedded chip & system design** competitions and **robotics contests**

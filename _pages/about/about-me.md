## 🤖 About Me
Hi!My name is ZhaoXuewen,reads like Joe Sherwin.You can call me Wayne.I'm an undergraduate student (2023–Present) at **Nanjing Normal University**, majoring in **Automation**.

My main interests are **Reinforcement Learning**, **Embodied AI**, and **Multi-Robot Systems**.
I found my direction a bit later than I hoped, but now I’m all in — steady progress, stronger projects, and better engineering instincts.


### 🔥 Research Interests
- **Reinforcement Learning for Robotics**  
  Policy learning for control (e.g., UAV-related tasks) and decision-making under constraints
- **Embodied AI**  
  Embodied agents that can perceive, reason, and act in real/sim environments (navigation / manipulation workflows)
- **Multi-Robot / Multi-Agent Systems**  
  Coordination and collaboration (multi-agent RL and system-level design)

### 🧩 I'm learning 
- **Books**：RL ROS2
- **Robotics stack**: ROS1 / ROS2, TF, RViz, URDF/Xacro  
- **Simulation**: Mujoco Gazebo Simspark
- **Manipulation**: MoveIt (motion planning)  
- **Engineering**: Linux workflow, Git

### 🏆 Highlights
- **National Second Prize**, National Undergraduate Electronics Design Contest (NUEDC)
